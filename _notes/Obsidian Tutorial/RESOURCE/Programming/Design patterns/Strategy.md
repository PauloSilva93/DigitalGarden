The Strategy Method Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern in software development that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. It's also known as the Policy Pattern. This pattern is used when you have multiple algorithms or strategies to solve a particular problem, and you want to switch between them dynamically based on specific conditions or user preferences.

The main purpose of the Strategy Pattern is to provide a flexible and extensible way to choose between different algorithms or strategies without modifying the code that uses them. This leads to better separation of concerns, improved maintainability, and easier testing.

Here's a high-level overview of the Strategy Pattern:

1.  Define an interface (or an abstract class) called `Strategy` that represents the common behavior for all the strategies.
2.  Implement multiple concrete classes (or subclasses) for each specific algorithm or strategy, adhering to the `Strategy` interface.
3.  Create a `Context` class that uses the `Strategy` interface to delegate the responsibility of executing the chosen algorithm or strategy.
4.  Clients interact with the `Context` class to utilize the chosen strategy without being aware of the specific implementation details.

Let's consider a simple example. Imagine you're building a navigation system that can calculate routes using different algorithms (e.g., shortest path, fastest route, or least fuel consumption).
