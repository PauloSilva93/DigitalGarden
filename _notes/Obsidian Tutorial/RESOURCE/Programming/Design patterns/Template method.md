The Template Method is another behavioral design pattern that is used to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass, allowing subclasses to redefine certain steps without changing the overall structure of the algorithm. This pattern encourages code reuse and enables the separation of concerns between common and specialized parts of an algorithm.

The main components of the Template Method pattern are:

1.  Abstract Base Class (or Interface): Defines the structure of the algorithm and contains the template method. The template method consists of a series of steps, where each step can be either a concrete method or an abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses.
    
2.  Concrete Subclasses: Implement the abstract methods defined in the abstract base class, providing specific implementations for the steps of the algorithm.
