A map with composite keys is a [[Data structures|Data structure]] used to store and retrieve values using a combination of multiple keys. In traditional maps, a single key is used to retrieve a corresponding value, but in a map with composite keys, multiple keys are combined to form a single key that uniquely identifies a value in the map.

For example, consider a map that stores information about students in a school, where the keys are the student's name and grade level. To retrieve information about a particular student, both the name and grade level must be specified as keys to form a composite key.

Maps with composite keys are useful when data needs to be accessed and retrieved based on multiple criteria, rather than just one. They can also be used to optimize performance in scenarios where the search for a single key value can be time-consuming, by allowing the search to be narrowed down using multiple key values.

Implementations of maps with composite keys vary depending on the programming language or framework being used, but the general concept involves creating a unique key that combines multiple key values using a specific algorithm or syntax.

## Example:

```javascript
// Create an empty map
const compositeMap = new Map();

// Define the composite key
const key = { name: 'John Doe', grade: 10 };

// Set a value using the composite key
compositeMap.set(JSON.stringify(key), 'Some value');

// Get the value using the composite key
const value = compositeMap.get(JSON.stringify(key));
console.log(value); // Outputs "Some value"
```
