Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, storing, and manipulating data in computer programming. They enable efficient access and modification of data, allowing developers to write more efficient and effective code. Some of the most common data structures include:

1.  Arrays: A fixed-size, ordered collection of elements, usually of the same data type. Elements can be accessed and modified using their index in the array.
2.  Linked Lists: A linear collection of elements, called nodes, where each node contains a data item and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the sequence. They allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements.
3.  Stacks: A collection of elements with Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order, meaning the last element added is the first to be removed. Operations are typically performed at the top of the stack.
4.  Queues: A collection of elements with First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order, meaning the first element added is the first to be removed. Operations are typically performed at the front and rear of the queue.
5.  Trees: A hierarchical data structure with a root node and child nodes branching off in a hierarchical manner. The most common types of trees are binary trees, where each node has at most two child nodes.
6.  Graphs: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges (connections) between them. Graphs can be directed, where edges have a direction, or undirected, where edges have no direction.
7.  Hash Tables: A data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to their associated values, allowing for fast and efficient access, insertion, and deletion of key-value pairs.
8.  Sets: A collection of distinct elements with no specific order. Sets are typically used to store and manipulate groups of unique items.
9.  Tuples: A fixed-size, ordered collection of elements that can be of different data types. Unlike arrays, tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be modified after they are created.
10.  Heaps: A special type of binary tree where each parent node is either greater than or equal to (max heap) or less than or equal to (min heap) its child nodes. They are often used for implementing priority queues.

These data structures are the building blocks of algorithms and are used to solve a variety of problems in computer programming. Each data structure has its own advantages and disadvantages, making them more suitable for certain applications than others.
